# 🌐 Static Website Deployment on Azure using GitHub Actions

This is a simple but complete **static website project** deployed on **Azure Blob Storage**, with automatic updates using **GitHub Actions**.

I created the website, set up the Azure environment using CLI, and connected it with GitHub so the site updates itself whenever I push new changes.
